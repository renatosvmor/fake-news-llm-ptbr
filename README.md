# IMPORTANT NOTICE

**This repository contains code and data from a paper currently under review. The content may be updated and additional details added after publication.**

# Description

This repository contains the dataset and code used in our study.

- [data/Fake.Br](./data/Fake.Br): This folder contains the training and test fake news generated by the LLM based on the Fake.Br corpus. The repository with the original news is available at [https://github.com/roneysco/Fake.br-Corpus](https://github.com/roneysco/Fake.br-Corpus).

    - Each line in the files train.txt and test.txt contains the name of a file from the original Fake.Br corpus, which forms the training and test sets for the experiments.

- [data/FakeTrue.Br](./data/FakeTrue.Br): This folder contains the training and test fake news generated by the LLM based on the FakeTrueBR corpus. The repository with the original news is available at [https://github.com/jpchav98/FakeTrue.Br](https://github.com/jpchav98/FakeTrue.Br).

    - Each line in the files train.txt and test.txt corresponds to a line in the original CSV file of the FakeTrue.Br corpus (starting from 0).

- [fake-news-generation](./fake-news-generation): This folder contains the source code for the class used to generate synthetic fake news.

## More Information About the Data

The text files available in the repositories [data/Fake.Br](./data/Fake.Br) and [data/FakeTrue.Br](./data/FakeTrue.Br) contain three key tags:

- `<originalText></originalText>`: Contains the original fake news article.
- `<syntheticText></syntheticText>`: Contains the LLM-generated fake news article.
- `<changes></changes>`: Contains an explanation requested from the LLM. In the prompt used to generate the fake news, we asked the LLM to list and explain the changes it made, detailing how these modifications contributed to transforming the news into fake news. This explanation is not used for classification purposes but was designed to facilitate human inspection.

For the experiments involving LLM-generated fake news, only the text inside the `<syntheticText></syntheticText>` tag was used.

**Important Note.** We manually inspected only the LLM-generated fake news in the test set.
